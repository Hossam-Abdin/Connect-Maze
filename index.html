                    <p>This solution was submitted and prepared by (Hossameldin Abdin, BELNRM) for the (JavaScript) assignment of the WebDevelopment course. 
                    I declare that this solution is my own work. 
                    I have not copied or used third party solutions. 
                    I have not passed my solution to my classmates, neither  made it public. 
                    Students’ regulation of Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE Regulations Vol. II. 74/C. § ) states 
                    that as long as a student presents another student’s work - or at least the significant part of it - as his/her own performance, 
                    it will count as a disciplinary fault. 
                    The most serious consequence of a disciplinary fault can be dismissal of the student from the University.
